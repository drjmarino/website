# Why I Like Breath Of The Wild

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

*Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. 

Itemized lists look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one



## Gameplay

The gameplay of Breath of the Wild is long but not annoying. It allows you to explore the game at your own pace and is anything but linear. You can go from area to area no matter the stage of the game you are in. It is also fun because the combat isn't difficult but requires focus. You can't just mindlessly swing your sword and win; you need to pay attention to attack patterns, armor, health, your own health, and any buffs you may have applied.

### 

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

     a. first sub
     b. second sub
     c. third sub

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Tables can look like this:

| Important information | Detail set 1 | Detail set 2 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| a | a1 | a2 |
| b | b1 | b2 |
| c | c1 | c2 |


and images can be specified like so:
