# Watkins Mill HS

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

*Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. 

Itemized lists look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one



## First header

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

### Second level header

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

     a. first sub
     b. second sub
     c. third sub

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Tables can look like this:

| Important information | Detail set 1 | Detail set 2 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| a | a1 | a2 |
| b | b1 | b2 |
| c | c1 | c2 |


and images can be specified like so:
