## AI Questions Discussion

### Question 1: The Debate "Junior Developer"

I use AI to write my Markdown formatting because I already know how to write it, and I just want to save time. What are some risks if you use AI to write code you don't understand?

### Question 2: The Test "Voice"

If I use Gemini to polish my writing, is it still my writing? If I send an email that AI rewrote, am I lying to the person receiving it about how good a writer I am?
